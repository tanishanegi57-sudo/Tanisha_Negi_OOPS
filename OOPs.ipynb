        "\n",
        "1)What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm based on objects that bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together to model real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A blueprint or template that defines the properties and methods of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-An instance of a class that represents a real entity with actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only essential features (what to do).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access to data (how it’s done).\n",
        "\n",
        "5)What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "- Dunder methods: Special Python methods with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__) that define how objects behave with built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6)Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- A mechanism where a child class acquires properties and methods of a parent class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- The ability of different objects to use the same method name but behave differently based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8)How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Achieved by bundling data and methods in a class and using access control (_protected, __private) to restrict access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9)What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A special method __init__() that initializes an object’s data when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10)What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class method (@classmethod): Works with class-level data and takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static method (@staticmethod): Independent of class and object data; behaves like a regular\n",
        "\n",
        "11)What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters; Python achieves this using default arguments or *args, not true overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "12)What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "- When a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13)What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- Allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "14)Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Enables flexibility, code reuse, and scalability by allowing one interface to work with multiple object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "15)What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "- A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods; defined using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16)What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "- Modularity, reusability, maintainability, scalability, and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "17)What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "- A class inheriting from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18)What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared by all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "19)Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "- __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__: Returns an official/debug-friendly representation, ideally recreating the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20)What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "- Used to call parent class methods, especially constructors, ensuring proper inheritance and MRO handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "21)What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "- A destructor method called when an object is garbage-collected; used for cleanup (not guaranteed timing).\n",
        "\n",
        "22)What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "- @staticmethod: No access to class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod: Accesses class data via cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "23)How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "- A child class overrides parent methods, and the method call is resolved at runtime based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24)What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Calling multiple methods in one statement by returning self from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25)What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "- __call__ purpose: Allows an object to be called like a function.\n"
